# Overview

Purpose of this short tutorial is to show some interesting topics from PHP which we should take care of
Please refer to code comments because this way might be helpful for some people as they will be able to read what they are following in the code.

When I have written this quick tutorial I assumed that there is already a basic understanding of programming in general or basic for every language.

For every tutorial, to make the output work, we may use PHP CLI.

> This tutorial is writen in comments along with the code, and in the same time is runnable. Reason is that after some discussion with a couple of programmers,
> I heard that some people learns more easy when reading in the same context with the code.
> It may work with some people, or not, It's just something that I want to try
> if is valuable or not. So please do not blame me and if you believe that I need to improve something drop me an email *<mihai.enescu@whocodeit.com>*, fork my repositories
> and add comments, buzz me on skype *(m.enescu)*.
> I am not searching for good words as I would be very happy with criticism because this way I know that I have to improve, as my goal is to help people to learn easier.

Enjoy and please do not forget to leave feedback!
